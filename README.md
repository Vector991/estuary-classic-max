Estuary Classic MAX skin for Kodi

This is a skin mod of the original Estuary Classic skin for Kodi.  Currently I have only skinned it for 1080 resolution at 16:9 dimensions, against v17 Krypton release.

I intend to post updates to at least a version 1.0, with wide monitor support as well.  Areas will look under construction as I comb through the XML and make changes.

Initially, I had only wanted to slightly mod the home screen to my liking and provide a friendlier desktop +mouse experience. I couldn't stop myself, so here we are, with a mod that can be described as a look and feel somewhere between Estuary Classic and Current.
